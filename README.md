# MERN Stack Todos App

This is my first full-stack project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It is a simple Todos app where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

You can check out the live application here: [MERN Todos App](https://mern-todos-by-pushkar.netlify.app/)

## Features

- Add new todos
- Mark todos as completed
- Delete todos
- Responsive design with a modern look

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: For database storage.
- **Express**: Backend framework.
- **React**: Frontend framework.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.

## Learning Journey

This app marks the beginning of my journey into the MERN stack. I'm still in the learning process, continuously improving my skills in both front-end and back-end development.



## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend` folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Set up your MongoDB connection in `.env`.
4. Run `npm start` in both the `backend` and `frontend` folders to start the app.
